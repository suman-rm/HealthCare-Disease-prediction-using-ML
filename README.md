# TOPIC: HEALTHCARE - DISEASE PREDICTION OF PATIENT’S USING ML MODEL

## BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT 

The healthcare field  is one of the leading research fields in today's landscape with  rapid advancement in technology and data. It is very difficult to manage huge amounts of patient data. Managing this data  is easier  through Big Data Analytics. There are  procedures to treat many diseases around the world. Machine learning is an emerging approach to disease prediction and diagnosis. This article describes symptom-based disease prediction using machine learning .Machine learning algorithms such as Naïve Bayes algorithm, SVC, GaussianNB, Random forest, K-means are used on the data set provided  and disease predictions are made.The implementation is done using the Python programming language.
 
## GOALS OF PROJECT

The goal of developing a classification system using machine learning algorithms is to make a significant contribution to solving health-related problems by enabling physicians to predict and diagnose illnesses early.
Minor medical queries can be resolved with the help of this system. Thus, saving time and money for the user as the user will not require to visit the doctor. 
Experiment with various Classification Models & see which yields greatest accuracy
 
 
## PROBLEM STATEMENT

To develop an AIML-powered platform that can provide immediate quality medical consultation to everyone at any place, make communication between patient and doctor easier. The Disease Prediction system is based on predictive modeling. It predicts the disease of user on the basis of symptoms that the user provides as an input to the system. The system analyzes the symptoms provided by the user as input and gives probability of the disease as an output.We  collected two datasets from Kaggle, trained the model using the  Training.csv dataset, and tested the model using the Testing.csv dataset. The Training.csv dataset contains 132 parameters that can be used to predict 42 different illnesses.. We are using Machine Learning techniques to build our platform.
 
## SOLUTION / PROPOSED SYSTEM
 
It might have happened so many times that you or your close ones need doctors help immediately, but they are not available due to some reasons.The Health Prediction System is an online consulting and end-user support  project. Here we provide a system that allows users to get instant advice about their health problems through an online smart healthcare system. The system is driven by various symptoms and diseases associated with these systems. This health prediction system allows users to share their symptoms and problems. It then processes the user's symptoms to look for various illnesses that may be related to them. Here we use an intelligent system of Naïve Bayes, SVM, GaussianNB, Random Forest, and a symptom-based Kmeans algorithm that will predict disease. Users can also  contact  nearby specialists. It will help users for easy medical treatment and diagnosis.
